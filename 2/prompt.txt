I have a brief task description from the QA like "Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond." Could you please provide a well structured task description for the developer which fits the conventions of Jira(Use Confluence Wiki Markup). The description have to contains:
Title
Description
Steps to Reproduce
Expected vs Actual Behavior
Environment (if known)
Severity or Impact
